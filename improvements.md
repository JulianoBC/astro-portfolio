# Website Improvement Suggestions

Here are some suggestions for improving the portfolio website:

## Homepage

*   **Clearer Call to Action:** The hero section could benefit from a clearer call to action. Consider adding a button or link that directs visitors to the projects or blog section.

## Projects Page

*   **Filtering/Categorization:** Implement filtering or categorization for projects if there are many.

## Blog

*   **Blog Post Excerpts:** The blog index page could display short excerpts of each post to give readers a preview.
*   **Search Functionality:** Implement a search functionality for the blog.
*   **Social Sharing:** Add social sharing buttons to blog posts.

## Accessibility

*   **Semantic HTML:** Ensure proper semantic HTML is used throughout the site.
*   **Color Contrast:** Check for sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements.
