    - **`Hero.astro`**:  A hero component typically used for the main banner section of a website's homepage. It's designed to capture the user's attention and convey the website's primary message or purpose.
    - **`LatestPosts.astro`**: This component is responsible for displaying a list of the latest blog posts. It fetches blog posts and renders them in a list, likely using components like `PostPreview.astro` to display each post's summary.
    - **`LinkPreview.astro`**:  A component to display a preview of a link, possibly used for external links or internal page links within the website.
    - **`PostPreview.astro`**:  A component used to display a preview or summary of a blog post, likely used in lists of blog posts to provide a brief overview and link to the full content.
    - **`Projects.astro`**: This component is designed to showcase projects, likely displaying a list or grid of project cards with descriptions and links to project details or live demos.
    - **`UnderConstruction.astro`**:  A component to indicate that a section or page is currently under construction. It's used to manage expectations and inform users about parts of the website that are not yet complete.
    - **`header/`**: This directory likely contains components related to the website's header, such as navigation menus, logos, and potentially search bars or other header elements.
- **`src/config/`**:  Likely holds project-specific configuration files or modules, potentially for application settings or API keys.
