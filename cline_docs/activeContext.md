# Active Context

**What you're working on now:**
I am currently reviewing the `src/components/Header.astro` component to identify and fix the issue preventing the theme toggle from working correctly.

**Recent changes:**
- Created the `cline_docs/productContext.md` file, documenting the project's purpose, problems it solves, and how it should function.

**Next steps:**
- Create the `cline_docs/systemPatterns.md` file, detailing how the system is built, key technical decisions, and architectural patterns.
- Create the `cline_docs/techContext.md` file, outlining the technologies used, development setup, and technical constraints.
- Create the `cline_docs/progress.md` file, documenting what works, what's left to build, and the overall progress status.
